With its user-friendly interface, learners can practice their foreign language skills and receive instant feedback.

## Features
- User-friendly interface with a clean and intuitive design.
- Interactive input field to enter text for language learning practice.
- AI-powered response generation for immediate feedback.
- Supports multiple foreign languages (specify the desired languages in the model configuration).
- Adjustable token limit to control the length of generated responses.
- Utilizes OpenAI's advanced language models (e.g., GPT-3 or GPT-4) for accurate and contextually appropriate responses.
